        <p>I'm a Information Technology student from University of the Cordilleras and destined to be a Web Developer(SOON). I chose this because even though I don't know everything about computers I am very fast at learning about them. It's never too late to start this occupation and I know if I put time and effort into this I know I will love it and I can be good at it. Let's start scrolling and learn more about me.</p><br />

                <blockquote> <b><i>Psalm 8:3-4</b></i>
                	<p>3 When I consider your heavens, the work of your fingers, the moon and the stars, which you have set in place, 4 what is mankind that you are mindful of them, human beings that you care for them?</p></blockquote>

        <h1>My storyline </h1>
            <div class="contentText"><p>"Believe in yourself" means a positive attitude. When you wake up in the morning, open your eyes, draw the curtain, enjoy the first sunlight of the day. And tell yourself "Have a happy day". Just everyone says, "You yourself decide whether you are happy today. Be sure you are happy today."Like a lyric says, "I love the sun, it makes me be thoughtful;I love the rain, it makes me be stronger and braver."This is so optimistic.Then you go to work or study, do it with your full enthusiasm.You should overcome your shyness, your timidity and your tension. Be brave and get courage from your heart, face up to your challenges. Say to yourself, "I'll try it, and I will try my best."Remember, no one can obstruct your progress.Believe in yourself, you can do it, you can manage it.Always share and show ideas with others, cooperate with others.</p><br />
        
        
          <p>Personality is what makes us unique and special. Our character determines who we are and how different we are from others.
            It is possible to find people who have similar appearances, but we will never find identical personalities. 
            I am going to prove this by taking the example of my character. 
            My goals, my achievements, my favorite activities are exciting and differ from any other person has in this world.
            Positive attitude to everything that happens is my value number one.
            My family taight me that no matter what happens it is significant to prserve a sincre smile on our faces. 
            Even if something bad occurs, my mom Janice and my grandma Remedios told me to find something positive. 
            As long as we are alive, and I am alive, there should be something good in the surrounding world. 
            This philosophy helps me to be happy and satisfied with everything that I get.</p></div>
        
        
        <h1>Yet Another One!</h1>
          <div class="contentText">
        <p>Family holds a special place in everyone's life. 
I love my family and can do anything for my family members. 
They have given me so much love and affection and have made me who I am today.
 I love my family more than anyone in this world. I will do everything just to make them happy. 
 Their happiness means a lot to me and I can do anything to keep them all happy.
 My mom is very kind and loving! 
She's my wonderwoman. She sacrificed herself all the way to singapore just to earn money for me and my sister Charleen.  <span>&bull;</span> <em class="moments">The moments where I found myself </p><br />
          <p> My lolo gives everything even though I don't need it. 
He's the superman of my life saving me from the void of darkness and lights up my whole world. 
Tatay Ekong and Nanay Talen are my guardians. They taught me how to live life with the glitter of positive happiness. 
<b>I love you Tatay and Nanay, the disciples of the Lord that given me a meaning for me to be meaningful person. 
I want him to continue his life without death.
 I want him to take my life for all the sacrifices he had given me.</p></div>
