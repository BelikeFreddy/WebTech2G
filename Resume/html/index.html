    <section><h2><i>"Believe in yourself" means a positive attitude. 
When you wake up in the morning, open your eyes, draw the curtain, enjoy the first sunlight of the day. 
And tell yourself "Have a happy day". Just as professor Galbraith says, "You yourself decide whether you are happy today. 
Be sure you are happy today."

Like a lyric says, "I love the sun, it makes me be thoughtful;
I love the rain, it makes me be stronger and braver."
 This is so optimistic.

Then you go to work or study, do it with your full enthusiasm.
 You should overcome your shyness, your timidity and your tension. 
Be brave and get courage from your heart, face up to your challenges. 
Say to yourself, "I'll try it, and I will try my best."
Remember, no one can obstruct your progress.
 Believe in yourself, you can do it, you can manage it.
 Always share and show ideas with others, cooperate with others.</i>
