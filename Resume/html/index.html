    <section><p>"Believe in yourself" means a positive attitude. 
When you wake up in the morning, open your eyes, draw the curtain, enjoy the first sunlight of the day. 
And tell yourself "Have a happy day". Just everyone says, "You yourself decide whether you are happy today. 
Be sure you are happy today."

Like a lyric says, "I love the sun, it makes me be thoughtful;
I love the rain, it makes me be stronger and braver."
 This is so optimistic.

Then you go to work or study, do it with your full enthusiasm.
 You should overcome your shyness, your timidity and your tension. 
Be brave and get courage from your heart, face up to your challenges. 
Say to yourself, "I'll try it, and I will try my best."
Remember, no one can obstruct your progress.
 Believe in yourself, you can do it, you can manage it.
 Always share and show ideas with others, cooperate with others.

            <h2>About Me and My Family</h2>

            <p> 
            Personality is what makes us unique and special. Our character determines who we are and how different we are from others.
            It is possible to find people who have similar appearances, but we will never find identical personalities. 
            I am going to prove this by taking the example of my character. 
            My goals, my achievements, my favorite activities are exciting and differ from any other person has in this world.
            Positive attitude to everything that happens is my value number one.
            My family taight me that no matter what happens it is significant to prserve a sincre smile on our faces. 
            Even if something bad occurs, my mom Janice and my grandma Remedios told me to find something positive. 
            As long as we are alive, and I am alive, there should be something good in the surrounding world. 
            This philosophy helps me to be happy and satisfied with everything that I get.
